				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
			</header>
			<p>I'm a writer. I use the name Antony Frost, though that's just a pen name (my real name is Antony Fox-Bramwell). I write about things that scare me, primarily. This means that my work usually ends up somewhere in the horror genre, though cyberpunk and dark fantasy get in the mix as well from time to time.</p>
			<p>The things that scare me largely fall into a few categories. There's abuse of power, the nature of reality, and questions of identity and free will. I write mainly short stories, though I'm trying to branch out into serials and get a novel or two out in the near future. The majority of my writing takes place in or around a fictional town called Ferenbrooke, which is sort of like a town I lived near as a kid (Cambridge) but messed up in fundamental ways. This means I get to re-use side characters and settings, shining new lights on them through the eyes of many doomed protagonists.</p>
			<p>I hope you like my stories. I hope they make you think. I hope your senses are honest with you and your mind stays loyal.</p>
